# Rule 1: Articles

In Esperanto, there is no indefinite article ("a" or "an" in English). There is only a definite article "la", which remains the same regardless of gender, case, or number.

## Usage Examples:
- **libro** = book, a book
- **la libro** = the book

Unlike English, the definite article "la" can also be used to indicate an entire class:
- **La leono estas danĝera besto.** → Lions are dangerous animals.
