In Esperanto there is no indefinite article like "a or an" in English, there is only a definite article, la.
The use of this article is very simple, just place it in front of a noun like this:

libro = book, a book - la libro = the book

The article can also be used for an entire group of things like in this sentence:

la leono estas dangera besto = lions are dangerous animals.
