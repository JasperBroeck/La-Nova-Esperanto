# Rule 9: Pronunciation

In Esperanto, every word is pronounced exactly as it is written. Each letter has only one sound, and there are no silent letters.

### Key Pronunciation Rules:
- **c** is always pronounced like "ts" in "cats".
- **g** is always hard, like "g" in "go".
- **j** sounds like the English "y" in "yes".
- **r** is rolled, similar to Spanish or Italian.
- **ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, ŭ** have consistent sounds and are never silent.

### Example Words:
- **Esperanto** → Pronounced "Es-pe-ran-to"
- **ĝardeno** (garden) → Pronounced "jar-DE-no"
