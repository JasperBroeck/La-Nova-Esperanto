# Rule 15: Borrowing Words

Esperanto borrows international words but adapts them to fit its orthography and grammar.

### Examples:
- **komputilo** (computer) → Derived from "komputi" (to compute)
- **arbaro** (forest) → From "arbo" (tree) + "-aro" (a group)
- **malbona** (bad) → Created using "mal-" (opposite) + "bona" (good)

Foreign words may be used directly, but it is preferable to form words using Esperanto rules.
