# Rule 2: Nouns

In Esperanto, nouns always end in **-o**. To form the plural, add **-j**. There are only two cases:
- **Nominative** (default form)
- **Accusative** (formed by adding **-n**)

Other cases (such as genitive, dative, or ablative) are expressed using prepositions.

## Usage Examples:
- **La hundo persekutis la katojn de la knaboj al la domo per bojado.** → The dog chased the boys' cats to the house by barking.
- **libro** (book) → **libroj** (books)
- **Mi havas la libron.** → I have the book.
