# Rule 11: Compound Words

Compound words in Esperanto are formed by simply combining words, with the main word placed at the end.

### Examples:
- **ŝipo** (ship) + **veturi** (to travel) → **ŝipveturo** (a journey by ship)
- **ami** (to love) + **plena** (full) → **amoplena** (full of love)
- **pagi** (to pay) + **povi** (to be able) → **pagipova** (able to pay)

To improve pronunciation, speakers may add an **o** or **i** between words:
- **nenio** (nothing) + **fari** (to do) → **neniofara** (doing nothing)
