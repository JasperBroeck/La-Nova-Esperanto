# Rule 12: Negation

In Esperanto, negation is simple: use **ne** (not). However, if another negative word is used, **ne** is omitted.

### Examples:
- **Mi ne faris tion.** → I did not do that.
- **Mi neniam faris tion.** → I never did that.
- **Li ne venos.** → He will not come.
- **Neniu venos.** → No one will come.

Unlike English, double negatives are grammatically correct in Esperanto, meaning they do not cancel each other out.
